# Welcome to My Digital Playground 🚀

Hey there, tech enthusiast! 👋 You've just stumbled upon **[andriskumpel.github.io](https://github.com/andriskumpel/andriskumpel.github.io)**, my personal corner of the internet where I experiment, build, and share my passion for code, innovation, and all things tech. This is more than just a portfolio—it's a living, breathing showcase of my journey as a developer, tinkerer, and problem-solver.

## What's This All About? 🤔

This repository powers my personal website, a hub for my projects, ideas, and experiments. Whether you're here to check out my latest creations, grab some code snippets, or just vibe with a fellow tech nerd, you're in the right place. Expect to find:

- **Web Dev Goodness**: Clean, modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with a sprinkle of frameworks like React or vanilla JS magic).
- **Cool Projects**: From interactive web apps to quirky side projects, I love building stuff that sparks joy (and sometimes chaos).
- **Tech Rants & Insights**: Occasional blog posts or notes about my learnings, failures, and "aha!" moments in the tech world.
- **Open Source Vibes**: Feel free to fork, contribute, or just roast my code—I’m all about learning and growing.

## What’s Inside? 📂

Here’s a quick tour of what you’ll find in this repo:

- **`index.html`**: The heart of my site—where the magic begins.
- **`css/`**: Stylish designs that make my site pop (no Comic Sans, I promise).
- **`js/`**: JavaScript sorcery for interactivity and fun.
- **`assets/`**: Images, icons, and other goodies to spice things up.
- **`docs/`**: Sometimes I write about tech, life, or why tabs > spaces.

## Why Should You Care? 😎

- **Inspiration**: Looking for ideas for your next project? Steal some of mine (with credit, of course 😉).
- **Collaboration**: Got an idea or want to hack on something together? Hit me up!
- **Learning**: I document my process, so you can learn from my wins *and* my facepalms.
- **Fun**: Tech doesn’t have to be boring. Expect some easter eggs and nerdy humor sprinkled throughout.

## How to Run This Locally 🖥️

Want to mess around with my site on your machine? It’s super easy:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andriskumpel/andriskumpel.github.io.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd andriskumpel.github.io
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or spin up a local server (e.g., with Python):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` and explore!

No fancy build tools required—just raw, accessible web dev goodness.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

This site is built with:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, GitHub Pages
- **Design**: A love for minimalism and user-friendly interfaces
- **Future Plans**: Maybe some WebGL, TypeScript, or a sprinkle of serverless. Stay tuned!
